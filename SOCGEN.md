The Value Proposition of Mobile Phone Usage during the COVID-19 Pandemic 
=====

### Introduction 
In early 2020, the world started to see the development of a pandemic like none has ever witnessed before and from this came a global state of emergency. Out of Wuhan, China came an unknown disease established as severe respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS - CoV - 2), otherwise called COVID - 19 (Dar et al., 2020, p.2). As a response, the United States employed the traditional well-established contact tracing method in order to identify cases and contain the spread of the disease. However, due to the unprecedented nature of this disease coupled with the lack of coordination from governmental officials and poor developed infrastructure from state and local public health departments, the current contact tracing process proved to be extremely labor intensive and cost ineffective (Braithwaite, Callender, Bullock, & Aldridge, 2020, p. 607 - 608). This has led to high rates of cases and mortality in the United States. To better contain the transmission of the virus, the United States should implement mobile phone technology to improve the current contact tracing pipeline and reduce any further unnecessary death in the population.  

### Background 
Contact tracing has been a key strategy in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The tracing process works by breaking the chain of infectious transmission from one individual to another (Braithwaite et. al., 2020, p. 607 - 608). The first step is to identify the confirmed COVID positive individual and reach out to them and determine who they may have come in close proximity with. The next step is listing all potential contacts and reaching out to this network and informing them of possible exposure. The last step is following up with the original exposed individual and their network to ensure no further unnecessary contact and spread of possible COVID - 19 symptoms (Dar et al., 2020, p.2). 

While simple in theory, the ability of the contact tracing infrastructure to succeed and contain the spread of the disease depends on a variety of factors. Contact tracing requires a timely detection of infected individuals which requires a large network of public health fieldworkers working collaboratively (Fahey & Hino, 2020, p.2-3), immediate notification to these individuals to enter a quarantine period, and for cooperative quarantine adherence. Any disturbances to these requirements can render the process of contact tracing ineffective or complicate the pipeline further. For example, some limitations of the standard contact tracing process includes an inaccurate recall of contact events from index cases, the time taken to manually contact positive cases and their network, and the time and resource consuming nature of the process (Braithwaite et. al., 2020, p. 607 - 608). 

The flawed process of manual contact tracing can be seen from the United States’s response to COVID-19 and their inability to contain the virus in a timely and efficient manner (Clark, Chiao, & Amirian, 2020, p. 1 - 3). The United States struggled with its COVID-19 test supply and struggled to provide consistent testing rates. At the start of the pandemic, many areas faced long lines, test shortages, and long waits for test results. This failure in equipping areas with testing supplies and results made health departments unable to trace positive cases they could not detect (Clark, Chiao, & Amirian, 2020, p. 1 - 3). The lack of clear and cohesive testing strategy comes from the nation’s leadership who were unable to come together and develop a plan to create a widespread surveillance testing program that is essential for the success of any mass public health initiative. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) remained silent for the beginning of the pandemic and official statements from the organization that eventually released were confusing and led to many states reopening before they reached an acceptable benchmark of low infectious transmission. 

The poor execution from the Trump administration and the CDC was an underfunded testing infrastructure and health departments confused about the strategy to contain the spread of the virus. Thus, many states were not able to eliminate infectious hotspots and break up transmissions chains in communities in the most opportune window leading to the nation’s current growing cases and inability to keep up with contact tracing. Figure 1 referenced below shows data collected from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and as presented, many states do not have updated information on the amount of cases and are missing information (CDC, 2020). This exhibits how overwhelmed and ill-equipped states are at tracking all cases in the civilian population. The result of the public health endeavors launched,  or lack thereof, have caused trust in White House Administration to decline (Clark, Chiao, & Amirian, 2020, p. 1 - 3).

### Solutions 
A possible solution to this laborious and flawed process is the integration of digital technology into contact tracing efforts in order to automate the data collection process and alleviate the government’s limited resources (Dar et al., 2020, p. 2-3). More specifically, the introduction of mobile phones into the contract tracing process can prove to be a vital tool in slowing down the spread of COVID-19 (Oliver et al., 2020, p.1) by speeding up the identification of infected individuals (Dar et al., 2020, p. 2-3). The usage of mobile phones will be able to more accurately track COVID - 19 cases and provide more information of positive individuals and any possible exposed connections in their network. Mobile phones have the ability to keep a record of an infected individual’s location while their phone is in use. This allows for public health officials to notify communities who were in the vicinity of these locations that they may be positive for the virus and should take quarantining measures (Oliver et al., 2020, p.1). The usage of mobile phones can correct for possible inaccurate recall of events that occur during the manual contact tracing process and reduce human error (Oliver et al., 2020, p.1). Mobile phones can also aggregate data and track which areas are adhering to quarantine policies and allow for decision makers to adjust their policies for improved adherence. Additionally, the benefits of mobile phone usage extend beyond the traditional contact tracing model; phones can also provide key insights into future strategic plans to contain the virus (Oliver et al., 2020, p.1). 

Mobile phones have the capabilities of modeling the spread of COVID-19 by gathering compiled information about positive cases in communities. Improved models can then be used to better predict upward positive case trends in certain geographic locations. State and federal governments then quickly act by mobilizing resources to these areas to slow down infection transmissions (Oliver et al., 2020, p.2). Real-time data will also allow us to assess current policies as well as the efficiency and quality of potential measures that will be put in place once quarantine policies are lifted (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). To allow for the American public to readjust to life after the pandemic, it will be necessary to find the optimal combinations of policies to enact as well as the correct time in which to install them (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). These combinations of policies will include decisions about general mobility for individuals to move within, adjusted policies on large gatherings, school closures, etc (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). 

As a comparison, a country who was able to successfully implement mobile technology into their contact tracing process and reduce the amount of positive cases is South Korea (Braithwaite et. al., 2020, p. 607 - 608). South Korea has had previous experience with nationwide outbreaks with the onset of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). These outbreaks have allowed South Korea to recognize the value of integrating mobile phone technology into their traditional manual contact tracing process (Braithwaite et. al., 2020, p. 607 - 608). Thus, South Korea has adopted an “‘open” data-first methodology which combines information from regular contact tracing and digital information from mobile phones such as global position system location to create a “‘virus patient travel log (Fahey & Hino, 2020, p.2-3).’” In addition to this travel log, South Korea has also integrated medical records data, patient interview data, credit card transaction data, and local camera footage into their data-first contact tracing infrastructure (Braithwaite et. al., 2020, p. 607 - 608).  The effect of digital integration into the contact tracing system has allowed for South Korea to maintain low rates of mortality and positive cases.  At the end of August, after adjusting for the 6.5x difference in population the United States has over South Korea, the United States has suffered from 47 times more cases and 79 times more deaths than South Korea (ScienceDaily, 2020).


### Concerns 
However, there remains controversy around the introduction of mobile phone monitoring public health purposes and an unwillingness to implement this technology into the current contract tracing process in the United States. This is a concern for the inability of public health authorities and researchers to be able to protect data for its citizens (Fahey & Hino, 2020, p.2-3). Figure 2 displays results from a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and findings show 26% of participants were very concerned about governmental usage of their private information (PRC, 2020). The concern for one’s digital privacy is valid due to previous news in the media about misuse of an individual’s data and the contribution to personal scandal and the lack of consensus on which policies should be established to keep this data safe (Fahey & Hino, 2020, p.2-3). The United States government and public authorities alike are either unaware or are lacking in the capacity to process large, complex databases of information. In addition, many governmental agencies are understaffed and do not have the technological teams or equipment ready to launch a digital endeavor into their current contact tracing process (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3).

### Appeals 
While these concerns are important to consider, mobile phone integration could help in reducing rates of positive cases and mortality. Significant impact could be made if governments and public officials worked together to address the concerns of the general populace in an informative way  (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). This includes making mobile phone efforts and data collection more transparent and possibly creating an external ethics and privacy advisory committee to oversee projects  (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). Figure 3 shows further results from the same survey conducted by the Pew Research Center and 77% of participants stated they saw little to no benefit in governmental usage of their private information with only 3.6% stating they saw a great amount of benefits from the government using their data (PRC, 2020). Thus, it is important the United States government works to educate the public of the trade-offs of using their personal data for the public good and the benefits of a digital initiative into current contact tracing  (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3).  Moreover, it is important state and federal governments become aware of their shortcomings and create multidisciplinary teams that will be ready to tackle the new problems that will come from creating a useful digital framework to assess the ongoing pandemic (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). Therefore while the privacy concerns are valid, mobile phone technology should be adopted in order to reduce mortality rates, slow the spread of the virus until a vaccine is safely created, and alleviate the strain on our exhausted medical system.

### Conclusion
The current contact tracing method is not equipped to deal with the COVID-19 crisis in the United States. Thus, it may prove to be extremely beneficial to integrate mobile phone technology in order to accelerate positive case detection and inform necessary parties of potential exposure. However, it may be difficult to implement this initiative due to various privacy concerns, including if the government has the technological capabilities of maintaining a large data infrastructure and whether governments will misuse personal data. If the general United States population could put aside their apprehensiveness about digital technology and the government can recognize their own shortcomings and work to remedy their weaknesses, this project could launch successfully. Furthermore, the benefits of mobile phones could last long after the pandemic, if proven successful. After the pandemic ends, mobile phone data can be used to analyze the impact of various interventions on the progression of the disease and cost benefit analysis of various quarantine restrictions (Oliver et al., 2020, p.3). If the integration of mobile phone technology and analysis assists with the pandemic and proves successful then it could usher in other future initiatives of digital technology to tackle other major global health problems (Ting et al.,  2020, p. 460). It could also increase general public and governmental acceptance of technology into healthcare and possibly address chronic disease (Ting et al.,  2020, p. 461).
