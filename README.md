## About 

My name is Brittney Le and I am a fourth year Human Biology and Society, B.S student studying at the University of California, Los Angeles. I am creating this website in order to showcase some of my projects. This site is a current work in progress as I am learning how to build websites as well as create compelling narratives to publish.
