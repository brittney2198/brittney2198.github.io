I am creating this website in order to showcase some of my projects. This site is a current work in progress as I am learning how to build websites as well as create compelling narratives to publish.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/brittney2198/brittney2198.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
